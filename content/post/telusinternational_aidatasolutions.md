Since I worked on the solutions for internal use with security policy, there is a limitation to show works online, but a summary of my works can be described as below while I was working on [TELUS International](https://www.telusinternational.com/solutions/ai-data-solutions?INTCMP=ti_solutions). It started from understanding the core problems and built a product workflow by user groups and concept based on those. The initial prototyping and user tests has gone through, proved the concept, and identified some improvements. Then the prototpying has been iterated piece by piece.

### Problems
There was no single foundation for multiple different user groups to get engaged in a AI data project. Many different tools and communication channels were identified which causes repetitive works and confusions when proceeding the AI projects in the project provider side. On the other hand, the public end user also had difficulties finding the right AI jobs and working on those.


### Workflow and concept design
Four main user groups are defined, and the each user journey map has drawn by the project flow with connections bettwen the users (product journey map image on the left). The interwined specific statuses have been shaped and designed according to the workflow (status workflow swimlanes image on the right).

### Proof of Concept (User testing)
Initial prototype has been created and tested with users to identify frictio npoints and find out possible usability problems. The method was unmoderated remote user testing due to covid situation and a variety of the users in different locations. The testing was planned of four parts; background questionnaire, prototype testing and questionnaire - tasks for each screen and followed questions, A/B test questionnaire, post questionnaire. The answers are sorted out with 477 notes and analyzed with affinity diagram.


### Iterative prototyping with details
Starting from sign up/in, the detailed clickthrough prototypes have been created and iterated. The below is an example for micro-interaction designs for setting up password.
