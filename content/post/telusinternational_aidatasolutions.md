Since I worked on the solutions for internal use with security policy, there is a limitation to show works online, but a summary of my works can be described as below while I was working on [TELUS International](https://www.telusinternational.com/solutions/ai-data-solutions?INTCMP=ti_solutions). It started from understanding the core problems and has built a product concept/workflow by user groups. The initial prototyping has quickly created, and user testing has conducted which can tell to validate the concept and identify further improvements. Then the process has been iterated, and the product has been growed gradually piece by piece.

### Problems
There was no single foundation for multiple different user groups to get engaged in a AI data project. Many different tools and communication channels were identified which causes repetitive work and confusion when proceeding with the AI projects in the project provider side. On the other hand, the public end-user also had difficulties finding the right AI jobs and working on those.


### Workflow and concept design
Four main user groups are defined, and each user journey map has drawn by the project flow with connections between the users (product journey map image on the left). The intertwined specific statuses have been shaped and designed according to the workflow (status workflow swimlanes image on the right).

### Proof of Concept (User testing)
Th initial prototype has been created and tested with users to identify friction points and find out possible usability problems already. The method was unmoderated remote user testing due to covid situation and for having a variety of the user sample in different locations. The testing was conducted with four parts; background questionnaire, prototype testing/questionnaire, A/B test questionnaire, and post questionnaire. The answers are sorted out with 477 notes and analyzed with affinity diagram. The result indicated that the concept is valid and gives value to the users. In addition, our team was able to discover more use cases in detail for a certain flow, and some improvements in the UI/visual elements.

### Iterative prototyping with details
Starting from sign up/in, the detailed clickthrough prototypes have been created and iterated. Below image may show an example of sign up/in prototypes (top) and micro-interaction prototypes for setting up passwords (bottom) - Figma design tool was used for most of the works.
