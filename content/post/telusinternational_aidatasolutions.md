Since I worked on the solutions for internal use with security policy, there is limitation to show works online. So this is a summary of my work stories from the problems to solutions while I was working on TELUS International (Technically speaking, the frist year of the work was with [Lionbridge](https://www.lionbridge.com), and the rest of the works was progressed with [TELUS International](https://www.telusinternational.com/solutions/ai-data-solutions?INTCMP=ti_solutions) as Lionbridge's AI department had been acquired by TELUS International (from Jan 01 2021). However, basically I have been working on the same business and same user workflow continously other than rebranding).

Starting from sign up/in, jobs -

### System unification for a single product
