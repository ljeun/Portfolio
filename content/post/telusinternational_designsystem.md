As the product grows and is integrated with other existing applications/microservices, our design team decided to create our own common design elements in Figma as a design system, for consistency and solid user experience of the product. For example, I've worked on the typography, avatar, card, file uploader, and data table components. At first, the use cases are collected and prioritized, and the detailed UI visuals and micro-interaction or behaviors are explored. Second, the UI component has been shaped, discussed/reviewed with team members, and iterated a couple of times. Finally, the design/prototype of the UI component is delivered to front-end developers and followed up as needed (In the front-end side, '[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org)' has been used).
