I was involoved in design and front-end development of UI framework for internal developers in Samsung SDS.




### UI component design 
  - Designed several basic sets of UI components such as button, progressbar, accordion, etc.
  - Analyzed different use cases, for example, with dynamic icon, with different angle (direction) for progressbar, error cases, etc.
  - Defined interactions/behaviors for the UI components, for example, buttons with hover, focus, disabled, pressed, clicked states)
### Front-end development
- Provided standard codes and documents of Html, CSS, and javascript as a template for a quick start
- Extended/Customized jQeury UI library for the designed UI components, especially for paginator UI
