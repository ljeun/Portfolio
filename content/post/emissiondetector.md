### Problem

Emission monitoring system was to detect, measure unexpected emissions and report the summary to decision-makers. The problem was that novice users (decision makers, client) have difficulties to find out critical information in their current system.


### Design Process

To solve the problems with the existing system, the following tasks were performed as below. 
 - Analyzed the current system in detail in both pragmatic and hedonic ways; functionality, UI, User Flows. 
 - Designed new concept by building a new user flow with user scenarios, consistent UI elements.
 - Visualized screens in detail in accordance with the new concept.
 - Created interactive prototype to see how it works by actions.
 - Evaluated the prototype with two evaluation methods; [AttrakDiff](http://attrakdiff.de/index-en.html) and [ASQ(After-Scenario-Questionnaire)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230786769_Psychometric_evaluation_of_an_after-scenario_questionnaire_for_computer_usability_studies_The_ASQ)



### UX Goals and how the system designed

After meeting with stakeholders and analyzing the existing system, we found out that the emission-related decisions are so critical, sometimes urgent, but the current system had been developed mostly with grid forms and many texts (although it is still in progress). Hence we identified that the major information should be concise and seen at glance when the application is opened. In this context, the UX goals were set as ease of use, clarity, naturalness, and functionality against the problem. The user flow was changed since the front screen has almost all information but not focused. The front page and menu(tab) were organized at first by the importance and frequency of the information, and the rest of screens were designed/visualized. The most improvements were the basic summary of emission user interface with quick filtering options.

### Challenge

It was difficult to satisfy for the completely different two user groups. Since the users include both technical engineers and the decision-makers like the administrative head of officer, there were huge gaps between them in terms of knowledge, familiarity and proficiency with the system. However, the most significant data was the same, which allowed us to focus on that view.
