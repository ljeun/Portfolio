### Problem

There was a bottleneck in the information flow between users and public organizing taxi call center, resulting in long queues on the phone. Notably, the users were mostly those who have difficulties in riding general public transportation so need easy access to the taxi service.

### Stakeholder/User Interviews

Many stakeholders have been found and interviewed in a wide range, including taxi driver, customer center employees, and different kinds of softwares in addition to the general users. Based on the interviews, stakeholder map was created, and our team was able to discover a critical painpoint that there is no single system from end-user side, and the only way to order a ride, find information, or communicate with taxi driver is a phone call. It was not developed so far since the main users are the elderly or the ones who have a certain difficulties, but through user interviews, we also found out many of users are using smart phone, although they use in their own different ways, for example, using VoiceOver.


### Accessible Mobile Application
 ![user research activity](/images/demola_sketches.png)
The solution was to provide an accessible mobile application which diverts some of the orders by the users from the phone queues. The app was iteratively designed for the visually impaired as an initial target user group. The first iteration with user interview/observation led to three key features as voice-reading/recording, zooming, and visual accessibility. The visuals were carefully considered with font size and color contrast, especially to meet the criteria of WCAG 2.0 Guidelines as basics; the minimum color contrast ratio should be more than 4.5:1 and more than 7:1 for enhancement. The users also varied for different color dependency, so the different color combinations were optionally designed in the next iteration. The voice was also tested by users by playing the pre-recorded human voice manually but the actual development was also shortly tested by our team members. <br/> In addition, one little idea was added that the user can take a picture just in front of them when they are waiting for the ride and send it to the drivers directly for their micro-location. This way, the user and driver are able to meet each other much easier, which is a significant moment especially during winter times in Finland.
