I have designed end-to-end user experience for enterprise solutions, for example, Nexshop for retail marketing and analysis (Now it's with the product [Brightics](https://www.samsungsds.com/eu/iot-platform/brightics-iot.html)). Due to the security policy, it is hard to show any specific visuals as a result, but I did design works from user research, concept design to screen designs for web or mobile with detailed specifications. I have used different kinds of tools such as Powerpoint, Balsamiq, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, and Invision.

### User research
 ![user research activity](/images/samsungsds_research.png)

- observed the context of use (field research) (e.g., Retail shops, Bus usage behavior in Vietnam)
- Interviewed stakeholders and users with semi-structured interview questions
- Evaluated usability in qualitative/quantitative ways.

### Analysis

- Analyzed existing system (features, user flow, UI)
- Created user journey map, user ecosystem, stakeholder map

### Ideation

- Had ideation workshops with other UX teams or stakeholders
- Created UX concept with user scenario or storyboard
- Planned new user flow, information architecture

### Designs

- Designed web/mobile screens using internal design system
- Visualized data (e.g., indoor usage map, usage rate comparison graphs)
- Supported internal designers by sharing UI design patterns/references
